# google-voice-click-continue
To pick a nice number from https://www.google.com/voice, it always need click "continue". 
To free my hands:
A simeple script click "continue" button is google voice number select popup to get the number you like.

Go to google voice,  click "Legacy google voice", which is easier to select the number.

This is script is running on the select phone number popup,  check the radio of your number, and running this script on Chrome console.
